TAPPER: Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami, this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate. For our viewers in the United States and around the world, welcome to Miami Florida, I'm Jake Tapper.
TAPPER: In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically. Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins. They're a winner-take-all state. So that's the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting.
